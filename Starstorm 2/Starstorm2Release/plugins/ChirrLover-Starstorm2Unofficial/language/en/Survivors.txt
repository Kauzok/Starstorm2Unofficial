After the EOD's smashing success with biomechanical augmentations, producing some of the finest combat engineers to ever come out of the department, they proceeded further with slightly more... shall we say, experimental designs.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"The department began looking into mental augmentation. It was definitely a leap, to be sure. Augmentation was already very cutting edge, but supplementing - or even replacing a damaged brain? It was a tall order. But the heads thought we could do it, so we obliged.\"\n\n\"Hm. What came of your project?\"\n\n\"Once prototyping was complete, we began the human trials. We got all sorts of folks as test subjects, they were vegetative, mentally unstable, broken people. We were told to fix them as best would could.\"\n\n\"And how did that go?\"\n\n\"It was... It was a travesty. Some of them were simply too far gone. There was nothing we could do. Those were the best cases. Worse was when they rejected the replacements. Some died in a swift immune response. The more cognisant ones begged for us to end the headaches they were having. Some of them just started screaming. They'd scream for hours and hours, sometimes for days even. And then they'd stop. They'd literally scream themselves to death.\"\n\n\"That's, um, a bit unsettling. Is that all?\"\n\n\"There was one. One who made it through the replacement. And it worked wonderfully. We got him in a vegetative state, no hope whatsoever, and we took him from that, and we gave him - maybe not his full life back, but perhaps something resembling it. You have no idea how thankful I was to hear that he was doing well.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose that's good to hear. So, what's happened to him?\"\n\n\"You know? I'm not sure. Other than some behavioral changes, which is to be expected, he was able to return to society rather gracefully. We've done check-ups on him every three months to analyze long-term effects, but... Actually? Now that I'm thinking about it, he didn't show up for it last month. Oh, well. I'm sure he's doing fine. I'll have to contact him about that.\"\n\n\"Um, alright, then. Thank you for your time, Dr. Rayell. Your testimony is... Well, it's certainly something. I hope to hear more about your projects in the future.\"\n\n\"Very well. I hope you find what you're looking for.\"\n\n<style=cMono>End of file.</style>",
